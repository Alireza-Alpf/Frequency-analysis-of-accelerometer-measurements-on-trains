# Frequency-analysis-of-accelerometer-measurements-on-trains
This data set contains both normal and failure datasets of metro bogies at a sampling frequency of 1024Hz, and carbody acceleration at sampling frequency of 20Hz. Dataset is collected for X, Y and Z axis vibration acceleration data of bogie and carbody. The data set includes about 50.8 minutes of normal data, 101.4 minutes of failure data, and 20 minutes of carbody data. Two energy harvesting sensor nodes was used to collect the vibration acceleration data from two metro bogies. One bogie is in normal state and the other is in a failure state. A 3-axis accelerometer is used in each sensor node to collect 3-axis vibration acceleration data. To collect data for carbody a smartphone is used from Garbatella metro station to Jonio metro station (App: Accelerometer). The unit of our dataset is m/s^2 and sensitivity is 100mg.
